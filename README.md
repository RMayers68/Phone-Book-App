# Phone-Book-App
This app uses Entity Framework Core to interact with a SQL Server database. It contains the basic commands that allow you to Create,Read,Update and Delete contact entries in a database. I had a much easier time putting this together as I start to understand interacting with databases more. EF seems to cut down a lot of the code that is needed when dealing with raw SQL, and makes it easier to handle entities. I will use a form of code first approach on a database for my personal projects in the future. I also read up on the format Git commits should be, and tried to maintain that standard for this project.
